# Russia-Ukraine-War-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis

Twitter is one of the most popular online platforms. Many users use it on a daily basis, expressing their views on various (current mostly) events, products, services, etc.
The development of algorithms, in various programming environments (e.g. Python, R etc.), that can process those textual data (Semi Structured Data), and produce information, is a very important process.
One of the most important such process is Sentiment Analysis, which is one of the basic techniques of NLP (Natural Language Processing). NLP essentially deals with the creation of algorithms that can understand and make conclusions from the simple everyday language of people,by doing various procedures such as translations, text summarization, speech recognition and the main object of this and the aforementioned, the Sentiment Analysis. Through this, the algorithm reads a text or a sentence, and extracts a result related to the author's feeling or opinion on the subject for which the text or sentence was written.
This result is usually "positive", "neutral" or "negative" (feeling or sentiment).

In this dissertation, several tweets were extracted through the Twitter API, related to the Russia-Ukraine war. Specifically, these are tweets that were published in the first 4 days of the war, and various analyzes were made on them. The main one was of course the SA, where machine learning tools were used as well as lexicon (or rule) based methods.
But beyond that, other analyzes of the data were applied too. The first one, concerns the most popular sites from which most tweets were made and the second relates to the most frequently used words in them.
Of course, before all of the above can be done, the data must be properly pre-processed, since the tweets in their original form are often quite illegible for the machine, and must therefore come in a more manageable format for further analysis.
Finally, the results of the research were commented and ideas for future work were suggested.
